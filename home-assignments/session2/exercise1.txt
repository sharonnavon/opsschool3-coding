`python cli.py --city dublin --forecast TODAY -c`

# Will print the following to screen:

“The weather in Dublin today is Cloudy with temperatures trailing from 5-10 celsius.”

----------------------
# running the following

`python cli.py --city dublin --forecast TODAY -f`

“The weather in Dublin today is Cloudy with temperatures trailing from 40-55 fahrenheit.”

----------------------
# running the following

`python cli.py --city dublin --forecast TODAY+3 -c`

# can be any number as long the weather-api allows it.
# if not a descriptive error need to be shown on the screen):

“
